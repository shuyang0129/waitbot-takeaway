# WaitBot Takeaway
WaitBot takeaway system is an in-app in messenger app, such as Line Messenger, Facebook Messenger. Users interact with chatbot to search restaurants and start to make their order by few simple steps. The chatbot will track the progress of the ordering and report to the users.  

Inside the messenger app, users could find three basic functions, namely search restaurant, review my favorite restaurant list, check the order history. Once users get search result, they could choose either collect the restaurant or start to make their order.
